## Untanglings: A Novel Approach to Behavioral Analysis of Process Models ##

### Implementation ###

Implementations of the baseline and reduction-based algorithms for computing representative untanglings of net systems are published in
`org.jbpt.petri.untangling.*` package of the _jbpt_ project.

### Experiments ###
  * June 2013. The enhanced version (based on run-trees) of the initial untangling experiment from March 2013 can be downloaded [here](http://code.google.com/p/jbpt/downloads/detail?name=UntanglingsExperimentJun13.zip).
